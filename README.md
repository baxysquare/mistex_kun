# Niko the MiSTeX Kun - The Legendary "Mistic" Ninja
Continuing where I left off with MiSTer, I set out to create a design for MiSTeX as well.  Originally I riffed on the LiteX logo by combining the CPU with a stylized M and X.  Then I decided to whip up a Ninja Kun, inspired by both The Family Computer Disk System mascot known as Disk Kun and the MiSTer Kun cat.

@CatPlaystation on Twitter named him Niko-kun and MiSTeX founder @hansfbaier liked it.  The rest is history.
